# Housing Price Prediction

About First Attempt:
I was following the 'Intro to ML' Course on Kaggle, where I discovered this competition
This contains my first attempt, which is a great improvement 
over the submission as per the course file, due to preprocessing of the categorical columns
Scope of improvement: Handling the columns with Na values in them...

About (Second) Pipeline Attempt:
I applied most of the techniques I've learnt : Pipelines, Extended Impute, Ordinal Encoder and OneHotEncoder.
This Model is much better than one before it. (Leaderboard Position 4k from 20k)
